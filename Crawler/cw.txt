Also there is change and new updates in status of project progress documents ? My question is if I make changes in existing document or replace it with updated version will it cause negative marking ?

Errors with 3.2
It seems like a lot of students are having errors with the grading for 3.2, but there's been no response from TAs, not even just acknowledging the problem by saying there might be discussion about it. Personally, I am not free after this Wednesday (and even then, I was hoping to have my finals week free for the rest of my classes after completing the last thing for this class). Honestly, I haven't had a problem with the rest of the class despite the back-and-forth, but this is getting to the point where it's the end of the semester, and I don't know where 5% of my grade could be going. I understand there's a lot on your plates, but could someone at least acknowledge that the Campuswire is being read? Could there please be an update? Is there a specific format the CSVs need to be in? Is there just a server error? What is going on?

MP 3.2 Path
I am having trouble figuring out how to connect my data to the google collab notebook so that it can read it. Currently, the line df = pd.read_csv(f"{MAIN_DIR}/train_data.csv") is erroring out on me I've put the notebook in my mp3 file on my google drive, along with the data, but a "pwd" command in the notebook says that my current path is /content. I've got the starter code that mounts drive.mount('/content/drive') I've tried other iterations, such as drive.mount('/content/drive/Mydrive') drive.mount('/Mydrive') drive.mount('/mp3') But nothing works.

Failure for every MP3.2 submission?
Hello, When MP3.2 was first released I successfully submitted and received a pass on the leaderboard. However, since the mp3.1_data was released every submission receives a 'Failure' in livedatalab with "no logs available yet. Your build may still be starting up". I have confirmed I have the livedatalab_config.json, metamia_results.csv and mp3.1_results.csv in my git submission. The submission is being pushed and is being shown in my submission history on Livedatalab. I'm even on the leaderboard from my original submission on 11/17 with a pass. Has anyone had this issue? I've reloaded my git and rerun the workbook twice and no luck. I've also sent a note to the TAs; hoping they can help and update my grade in Coursera. Cheers, tgc3

Project runtime requirements?
The project instructions in Week 1 on Coursera say "Software usage tutorial presentation (20%): 10% of the grading is based on completion and the remaining 10% is based on result of testing the software by graders". However, I am encountering long runtimes for my code (due to using named entity recognition on 6500+ documents). It runs, but takes 3+ hours. I can reduce this time, but would lose accuracy, which is not desired. For peer-grading purposes, I thought I might select a small subset of documents randomly (allowing the grader to select random seed if desired) and show that the code runs on this subset (reducing runtime to just a couple minutes) to accomplish the second 10% of the Software Usage Tutorial Presentation grading requirements. **In general, how should students address long runtimes and proving their application/code base works for grading in the "Software usage tutorial presentation" category? ** Thanks!

How can EM always increase the liklelihood but at the same time get trapped in a local optimal solution? Does always increase the likelihood mean from the initilization to the last step, and not necessarily from say step k to step k+1?

MP3.2 return status is always FAILURE
For those who have gotten the livedatalab grader to work, what exactly are we supposed to submit? I have attempted to submit the following three things multiple times: - livedatalab_config.json - metamia_results.csv - mp3.1_results.csv In livedatalab, it keeps giving a FAILURE response, but has no troubleshooting to help (it just constantly says: "No logs available yet. Your build may still be starting up."). Github says it successfully delivered my payload with a 200 response. metamia is a 500+1("label) line csv file (same as the test set) mp3.1 is a 420+1("label") line csv file (same as the test set).

Suppose we have the following training dataset of emails where each email is associated with the label spam or ham (not-spam). We want to train a Naive Bayes classifier based on this dataset. d1 is Spam and have words: Save Money No Fees d2 is Ham and have words: Back to the Future d3 is Ham and have words: Back to School Night Using maximum likelihood estimation without smoothing, what is P(Spam)? 1/3 1/2 1/4 1/5 Assume the same given as in Question 5 and that additive probability smoothing is being used to evaluate P(w|Spam) and P(w|Ham), where |V|=10 is the size of the vocabulary. ![Screenshot%202023-11-29%20at%207.11.17%20PM.png](https://files.campuswire.com/4a2f7542-f146-4a8d-b5cc-5c40984d22e5/25eb0d2d-6730-49b9-bc62-e7754852f683/Screenshot%202023-11-29%20at%207.11.17%20PM.png) Which of the following documents has the highest probability of being classified as spam by the Naive Bayes classifier? Hint: You should not need to compute the actual probabilities to answer this question. You can answer it by inspecting the score function on the slide entitled "Anatomy of Naïve Bayes Classifier." (Lecture 11.1) “No fees” “Save money back” “Save money future” “Future school no fees”

Horrible test taking experience
Went through 4 proctors & took 1.5 hours just to get into the exam. ProctorU kept booting me out and shutting down the lockdown browser. ProctorU is horrible, I don't understand why a top CS program is using such a jurassic software. Use CBTF or literally anything else. On top of that, I had to pay $28 to take the exam. $40,000 in tuition isn't enough? TLDR: Worst exam experience I've had due to the horrible proctors & software of ProctorU. Do better
