What to turn in for Documentation and Presentation
I can't find clear information about this anywhere - for documentation, are we talking about code docs, README, or a writeup report? for presentation again are we talking about a recording, slides, or demo the projects along with the document writeup if there's such artifacts requirement? Any clarification here would be greatly appreciated!

Is the grade distribution different for 4 credit students?
Noticing there is a grade breakdown that does not include the tech review paper. How much does the tech review grade account into our total grade? Also, will we receive grades for tech review soon?

Peer Review Clarification
Should we wait **after** December 8th to do the peer reviews? Some of the questions require us to confirm the existence of materials that are due on the 8th (e.g. source code, presentation). If I mark "source code not yet due" on the peer review form in CMT, am I expected to change it after the 8th if I choose to complete the peer review now? ![image.png](https://files.campuswire.com/4a2f7542-f146-4a8d-b5cc-5c40984d22e5/220dd038-7a91-42af-99d9-0fc402d2e85f/image.png)

Peer review completion dates and impact on final grades
Hi Prof, TAs, Everyone, ![image.png](https://files.campuswire.com/4a2f7542-f146-4a8d-b5cc-5c40984d22e5/a4275f81-f7fd-4672-bdd0-19f7c8640864/image.png) If project deliverables are due on Dec 15, could you please provide clear due dates for when **Peer Reviews need to be completed?** If peers do not submit reviews, what impact does it have on grades? As it stands today, it seems like this deliverable will take us past the last day of the semester (Dec 15). Please advise soon to plan appropriately.

Peer Review
I just looked at CMT and clicked on the reviewer tab, and there were no projects there for me to review. I have seen other posts were people have had teams to review. Are the teams to review still being sent out, or is something wrong on my end?
