What to turn in for Documentation and Presentation
I can't find clear information about this anywhere - for documentation, are we talking about code docs, README, or a writeup report? for presentation again are we talking about a recording, slides, or demo the projects along with the document writeup if there's such artifacts requirement? Any clarification here would be greatly appreciated!

Peer Review Clarification
Should we wait **after** December 8th to do the peer reviews? Some of the questions require us to confirm the existence of materials that are due on the 8th (e.g. source code, presentation). If I mark "source code not yet due" on the peer review form in CMT, am I expected to change it after the 8th if I choose to complete the peer review now? ![image.png](https://files.campuswire.com/4a2f7542-f146-4a8d-b5cc-5c40984d22e5/220dd038-7a91-42af-99d9-0fc402d2e85f/image.png)
